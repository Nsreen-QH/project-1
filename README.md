# Overview

The first project in Data Science Immersive course with General Assembly. we're taken a look at the number of traffic accidents and driving licenses issued in Saudi Arabia and did an analysis including:
- Datasets Description
- Data Import & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Outside Research
- Conclusions and Recommendations


# Problem Statment

Road traffic accidents are a major health hazard in Saudi Arabia and the possibility of this happening is driving without a driver's license, where before receiving the license a driving test is carried out and the drivers are validated, so in this project, we will analyze the data of traffic accidents and driver license to find solutions.



# Executive Summary

We have focused on two data sets in this project traffic accidents and driving licenses, and we find some correlate to each other which can we use to help us find solutions. We find that the number of accidents is declining over the years while the number of licenses is increasing, which is a very good indicator. We also find that there is an immense gap between Saudi Arabia's three main regions and the other regions.
